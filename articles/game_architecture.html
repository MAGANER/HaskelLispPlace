    <h1>My thoughts on the game architecture</h1>
<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

 <p> 
     When you make a decision to write a game, you have two ways to do this:
     Pick up the game engine or use a programming language you like with
     some library to do things associated with drawing, playing sound, managing input, e.t.c.
</p>
<p>
     If you chose the first way, then perhaps this article will not be interesting for you since the game engine has
     everything you need and all you might need in the future. It is the mighty tool that hides all complexity from you
     and provides the ability to reach the goal as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
    This article is about the second way mentioned. On the one hand, it can look easier if you're familiar with
    some programming language, then it's not a big deal to choose a library and to write yet another application
    and that's true for small games only.
    On the other hand, situations become different as the game grows. The poorly designed structure of the game's
    logic is the root of evil, leading to bad maintainability and an associated inability to extend the game.
    A problem of the same kind was faced by the programming industry a long time ago.
    The procedural programming paradigm turned out to not be suitable enough for applications
    with a large amount of source code, so Alan Key's OOP looked like a magic bullet to solve this problem.
    But OOP is good if you know how to use it. It's not just different syntax, but an entirely different way to express ideas in
    terms of classes and objects.
    <br><br>  
    So, this is an article, and the ideas presented here are the result of my reflections about mistakes I made during
    developing my old game, "I love pain".
    
    <br><br>I already implemented these ideas in another game "Snektris", so I have something to say.
</p>

<h3>The definition of a game or the statement of a question</h3>
<p>
    First of all, I should answer the question: What is a game? And there is a suitable definition.
    A game is a set of objects and rules to operate over these objects. This definition is the starting point of
    my further reasoning, and if this article ironically hints at its philosophical nature,
    then this is close to the truth, since it's not a tutorial or manual. It sheds light on the problem
    and tries to offer a solution.
   <br><br>
   
   The definition above has everything I want to explain: objects and rules, as well as how to combine them together
   in a ready-made and well-programmed game.
   <br><br>
   
   Let's start with objects. There are plenty of objects involved in the game process: monsters, bullets, coins,
   tables, giving you bad advice, deadly traps, and many other ones. Each of them is represented in a different way
   and has a unique way to interact with a player. The language you would use probably supports OOP, unless it's not
   purely functional programming language like Haskell. Even if you are going to use C, you can implement C-style
   OOP: Gtk and Gnome are good examples.
   <br><br>
   
   <strong>So this is the first principle: everything in a game is an object.</strong>
   <br><br>
   
   It's time to think about rules. Rules are a bunch of functions, procedures, and class methods, and all they do is
   transforming some state A into state B. Increase the player's health, when you drink a potion. Update the ammo variable,
   if player presses the R button. Nothing special. But I provide these examples to reveal the notions mentioned.
   <br><br>
   
   <strong>The second principle is partially derived from Unix's philosophy:
   One rule is to do one task as well as possible.</strong>
   <br><br>

   It's not good practice to write one big procedure that performs all the necessary actions.
   This is bad code. Imagine that you discover a function written by your teammate or even yourself
   that checks collisions and updates the player's inventory. People call it spaghetti code.
</p>


<h3>Uniting the pieces</h3>
<p>
   The game definition shows the gears of which it consists, but it doesn't say anything
   about their union. So after I described the building blocks of each game, now
   I'm going to dive deeper to show how everything can be combined.
   <br><br>
   
   Let's imagine a platformer game. It has a start menu that meets the player after he runs the game,
   game itself and the screen of death.
   <br><br>
   
   Each stage of the game—the menu, jumping on platforms, and death screen—are separate scenes.
   <br><br>

   To represent a scene you are going to use class and we're getting closer to see how to unite
   objects of scene with events,apllied to these objects. Each scene has one thing in common -
   they usually end due to special conditions - pressing the "Start Game" button, death or reaching a goal - 
   completion of the level. Each scene inherits from a abstract class, which fields and methods will be
   described further.
   <br><br>

   So there is an object that has only one thing to do: process the current scene and switch to another one if the current
   scene should be changed. I call it Scene Manager. As input, it gets the first scene, then it creates a scene object
   and call the "run" method if the scene shouldn't change (the scene has a method to check it). That is an obvious reason
   why	each  scene must inherit the abstract class to use polymorphic methods. In case the scene needs to be changed,
   the manager can obtain the next scene from the current scene, so every scene has a method
   (that is defined as virtual in the base class) that returns the next scene.
   <br><br>


   At this point, we discover an advantage of the approach: source code does not become a mess, and there is no
   problem to write the project within a team because all classes are isolated from each other. So one developer can
   work on one class, and it won't afflict another developer's task.
   <br><br>

   But what about the scene itself? How does it look? Due to inheritance from an abstract scene, it must
   implement the run method as well as other virtual methods. You might think of the "run" method as a regular "update"
   function in the game cycle.
   Also, because of the single responsibility principle, one class has only one role in the application architecture, so scene
   manager, being passed to the Render or Window class, processes all scenes, but it doesn't draw,
   since it's what the Render class should do.
   Following the second principle related to events or functions, the totality of which forms the game cycle,
   menu cycle, we can face a big function with a high number of conditional branches associated with some events and
   events invoked without any condition.
   <br><br>
   Developing every event, you write a function, then invoke it inside the "update" function, and as a result, you
   build your game and test the written function, repeating these steps until the game is finished.
   <br><br>
   I have an abstraction to make the scene more declarative. As you already see, there are only two types of events in
   game: conditional events and non-conditional ones. So an event can be represented as a pair of two functions (this pair
   must be a class if you use OOP language) - predicate (condition) and action.
   It gives an ability to tightly bind action with conditions to execute it. In the case of non-conditional events,
   A predicate is a boolean function that always returns true. This short description lets us create a class to manage events
   objects: it has two lists for each type of event (conditional and non-conditional) and methods to add depending
   on type, and the last two ones are dedicated to return events.
   <br>
   Sure, you can create your own types of events. For example, "Snektris" has a type of event that is invoked after
   snake's death, but they must be executed in the game, and after finishing these events, the game switches to the death screen.
   <br><br>
   Therefore, each scene needs its own event manager. That's why I say we can write scenes in a more declarative style.
   Event manager is defined in the base class, so while creating your own scene, you don't need to create it, but write
   events and pass them to the event manager. And the scene manager gets the events'
   lists and iterates over them, checking conditions and running them in case they should.
   <br><br>
   It is a brief but fairly complete explanation. Now, summing up, let's look at how everything works together:<br><br>
   
   <strong>1)</strong>Scenes are obviously rendered, so there is a Render or GameWindow class. Its goal is to use a scene manager that
   process the current scene—run events, draw objects, switch to another one when time has come.<br><br>
   <strong>2)</strong>Scene Manager gets a list of scenes, and it doesn't know almost anything about scenes—only related events.<br><br>
   <strong>3)</strong>The scene is where all the hard work is being done. It is simply a combination of objects and an event manager that has
   a sequence of actions (events) that should be done while the scene is running.<br><br>
   <strong>4)</strong>An event is a pair of predicate and function.<br><br>
   <strong>5)</strong>Event manager is just class that sorts events and provides easy access to them.<br><br>
